# The Movie Maker Journal

This project is fullstack app modeled somewhat after Letterbox'd, but of course, with my own flare. 

Backend code: https://github.com/LongDefeat/movie-maker-journal-api/

The purpose of this app is purely to display modern programming practices in React such as:

- data validation
- user authentication
- React features such as modals
- React-Bootstrap
- CI/CD using Heroku and Github
- deployment to Heroku
